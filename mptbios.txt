A SAS BIOS is the bootable ROM code that manages SAS hardware resources. It is 
specific to a family of Avago Technologies SAS controllers or processors.
A SAS BIOS integrates with a standard system BIOS, extending the standard 
disk service routine provided through INT13h.

During the boot time initialization, the SAS BIOS determines if there are other 
hard disks, such as an IDE drive, already installed by the system BIOS.  If 
there are, the SAS BIOS maps any SAS or SATA drives it finds behind the drive(s)
already installed. Otherwise, the SAS BIOS installs drives starting with the
system boot drive. In this case, the system boots from a drive controlled by
the SAS BIOS. The Avago Technologies SAS BIOS supports the 
BIOS Boot Specification (BBS).

The next section, "Boot Initialization with BIOS Boot Specification (BBS),"
discusses selecting boot and drive order.


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Features *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

The SAS BIOS features include:

o Configuration for up to 16 adapters-any 4 can be chosen for
  INT13 (bottom) support

o Support for Message Passing Technology

o Support for the following family of second-generation SAS Controllers:
    o SAS2004
    o SAS2008
    o SAS2108
    o SAS2116
    o SAS2208
    o SAS2308

o Support for SAS and SATA devices

o Support for Integrated RAID initialization (with proper firmware)


*  *  *  *  Boot Initialization with BIOS Boot Specification (BBS) *  *  *

The SAS BIOS provides support for the BIOS Boot Specification (BBS) which
allows you to choose which device to boot from by selecting the priority.

To use this feature, the system BIOS must also be compatible with the BBS. If
your system supports the BBS, then you will use the system BIOS setup menu to
select the boot and drive order. In the system BIOS setup, the Boot Connection
Devices menu appears with a list of available boot options. Use that menu to
select the device and rearrange the order. Then exit to continue the boot
process.


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * CD-ROM Boot Initialization *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

The SAS BIOS supports boot initialization from a CD-ROM drive.
The five types of supported emulation are:

     o No emulation disk
     o Floppy 1.2 Mbyte emulation disk
     o Floppy 1.44 Mbyte emulation disk
     o Floppy 2.88 Mbyte emulation disk
     o Hard disk emulation

The type of emulation assigns the drive letter for the CD-ROM. For example,
if a 1.44 Mbyte floppy emulation CD was loaded, then the CD-ROM drive would
become the designated A: drive, and the existing floppy would become drive B:.


*  *  *  *  *  * Starting the SAS BIOS Configuration Utility *  *  *  *  *  *

If you have SAS BIOS version 7.XX, and it includes the SAS BIOS Configuration
Utility, you can change the default configuration of your SAS host adapters.
You may decide to alter these default values if there is a conflict between
device settings or if you need to optimize system performance.

You can see the version number of the SAS BIOS in a banner displayed on your 
computer monitor during boot. If the utility is available, this message
also appears on your monitor:

     Press Ctrl-C to start Avago Technologies Configuration Utility...

This message remains on your screen for about five seconds, giving you time
to start the utility. If you decide to press "Ctrl-C", the message changes
to:

     Please wait, invoking SAS Configuration Utility...

After a brief pause, your computer monitor displays the Main Menu of the
SAS BIOS Configuration Utility.


These messages may appear during the boot process:

1.  "Adapter removed from boot order!" appears when an adapter is removed from
    the system or relocated behind a PCI bridge.

2.  "Adapter configuration may have changed, reconfiguration is suggested!" 
    appears if none of the information in the NVRAM is valid.

3.  "Updating Adapter List!" appears when less than four adapters are in the
    boot order and more adapters exist than are shown.

4.  "Preferred boot device is missing, reconfiguration is suggested!" appears
    if the user has selected a preferred or alternate boot device and is not
    detected during BIOS initialization.

IMPORTANT: The SAS BIOS Configuration Utility is a powerful tool. If, while
           using it, you somehow disable all of your controllers, pressing
           Ctrl-A (or Ctrl-E on version 5.00 or later) after memory
           initialization during reboot allows you to re-enable and
           reconfigure.

     Note: Not all devices detected by the Configuration Utility can be
           controlled by the BIOS. Devices such as tape drives and scanners
           require that a device driver specific to that peripheral be 
           loaded. The SAS BIOS Configuration Utility does allow parameters 
           to be modified for these devices.

Adapter      

   Indicates the specific Avago Technologies SAS controller type.

PCI Bus      

   Indicates the PCI Bus number (range 0x00 - 0xFF, 0 - 255 decimal)
   assigned by the system BIOS to an adapter.

PCI Dev

   Indicates the PCI Device (range 0x00 - 0x1F, 0 - 31 decimal) assigned
   by the system BIOS to an adapter.

PCI Fnc

   Indicates the PCI Function (range 0x00 - 0x7, 0 - 7 decimal) assigned
   by the system BIOS to an adapter.

PCI Slot

   Indicates the PCI Slot the controller is located in.

FW Revision

   Displays the MPT Firmware version and type (IR or IT)

Status

   Indicates whether an adapter is eligible for Avago Technologies software control
   or is reserved for control by non-Avago software 
   (Enabled, Disabled, Error).

   Enabled indicates the BIOS is either currently controlling the adapter
   or will attempt to control the adapter upon reload.

   Disabled indicates the BIOS is either not controlling the adapter or
   will discontinue control of the adapter upon reload.

   Whether Enabled or Disabled, the user will still be able to view and
   modify settings for the adapter.  The Boot Support setting in the Adapter
   Properties menu can be used to change the status of this setting.  The
   BIOS must be reloaded (e.g., system rebooted) in order for a new Boot
   Support setting to take effect.

   Error indicates that the BIOS encountered a problem with the adapter.
   Viewing and modifying settings for the adapter is allowed but the
   information and functionality available may be limited.

Boot Order

   The Boot Order specifies the order in which adapters will boot when
   more than one adapter is in a system. Up to four adapters in a system 
   may be selected as bootable.

   To add an adapter to the boot list, press Insert while on the Boot Order
   field of the adapter. To remove an adapter from the boot list, press Delete
   while on the desired adapter's Boot Order field. The -/+ keys can be used
   to change the adapter's position in the Boot Order.

   Indicates the specific Avago Technologies SAS controller type.

PCI Slot

   Indicates the PCI Slot the controller is located in.

PCI Address

   Displays the PCI Address assigned by the system BIOS to the adapter.
       Bus value has range 0x00 - 0xFF, 0 - 255 decimal.
       Device value has range  0x00 - 0x1F, 0 - 31 decimal.

FW Revision

   Displays the MPT Firmware version and type (IR or IT)

SAS Address

   Displays the SAS Address assigned to this adapter.

Status

   Indicates whether an adapter is eligible for Avago Technologies software control
   or is reserved for control by non-Avago software (Enabled, 
   Disabled, Error).

   Enabled indicates the BIOS is either currently controlling the adapter
   or will attempt to control the adapter upon reload.

   Disabled indicates the BIOS is either not controlling the adapter or
   will discontinue control of the adapter upon reload.

   Whether Enabled or Disabled, the user will still be able to view and
   modify settings for the adapter.  The Boot Support setting in the Adapter
   Properties menu can be used to change the status of this setting.  The
   BIOS must be reloaded (e.g., system rebooted) in order for a new Boot
   Support setting to take effect.

   Error indicates that the BIOS encountered a problem with the adapter.
   Viewing and modifying settings for the adapter is allowed but the
   information and functionality available may be limited. The possible
   error conditions are:
   Device Initialization Failed: Device initialization has failed. May be due to invalid IO Port address.
   Issuing IOC Facts failed: This error may be due to FW fault state.
   Bus Master Error: This error may be due to bus mastering bit was not set
   PCI Chip Malfunctioning: If the adapter was not found or was not properly functioning.
   Discovery Error: The Phy discovery error displayed in D_ERR 0xXXXXXXXX on Phy X.

Boot Order

   The Boot Order specifies the order in which adapters will boot when
   more than one adapter is in a system. Up to four of the total
   adapters in a system may be selected as bootable.

Boot Support

   Specifies whether an adapter is eligible for Avago software control
   or is reserved for control by non-Avago software 
   (Enabled BIOS & OS, Enabled BIOS Only, Enabled OS Only, Disabled, 
   default: Enabled BIOS & OS).
     If Enabled BIOS & OS, then both the bios and OS driver will control the
   adapter.
     If Enabled BIOS Only, then the adapter will be controlled by the bios,
   but OS drivers will not control it.  This setting may not be supported by
   all OS drivers, for example there is no means to disable an adapter in a
   Windows driver.
     If Enabled OS Only, then the bios will not control the adapter but the
   OS driver will control the adapter.
     If Disabled, then the bios will not control the adapter when loaded.
   However, the adapter will still be visible through the Configuration
   Protocol.
     Changes to this setting will be reflected in the Status field on the
   main Adapter List menu.  The new setting will not take effect until the
   bios is reloaded (e.g., system rebooted).

   Indicates the scan order for this device. This would be the equivalent of 
   a SCSI ID in parallel SCSI.

Slot Number

   Indicates the slot number for this device. This is used by enclosures to 
   locate devices.

RAID Member

   If this disk is included in an integrated RAID volume, then this value will 
   be 'Yes'. The disk will be 'No' if it is not a member of an IR volume.

Disk Capacity

   This is the size of the disk in Gigabytes.

Serial Number

   This field indicates the Serial Number of this device.

Format

   Press Enter to enter the low-level format screen for the device. Once
   on the format screen (see below) you can start a low-level format.

   If enabled, this option allows low-level formatting on a disk drive.
   Low-level formatting will completely and irreversibly erase all data on the
   drive.

   Note: Formatting will default the drive to a 512-byte sector size even if
         the drive had previously been formatted to another sector size.

Verify

   Press Enter to enter the verify all sectors screen. Once on the Verify 
   screen (see below) you can start a verify of all sectors on the device
   and if needed reassign defective Logical Block Addresses (LBAs).

The Format and Verify screens have similar layout and are accessed by hitting 
Enter on the appropriate field on the Device Properties screen.  
These screens include an Elapsed Time and status bar that begin incrementing 
once the operation is started and enable user to determine current progress of 
the operation.

Once on the Format screen, pressing the "F" key will begin the format.

     ***ONCE FORMAT HAS STARTED IT CANNOT BE STOPPED OR CANCELLED***

Set/Clear Preferred Boot Device ('Alt+B')

   Press this key to set the highest priority (preferred) boot device. This can
   be either an INT13 device, or an active RAID volume. This device will be the
   first device the core BIOS will look for when attempting to boot. Pressing
   Alt+B for a device that is already the preferred boot device will clear the
   device's boot status.

Set/Clear Alternate Boot Device ('Alt+A')

   Press this key to set the second priority (alternate) boot device. This can
   be either an INT13 device, or an active RAID volume. This device will only
   be checked if the preferred boot device cannot be located by the core BIOS. 
   Pressing Alt+A for a device that is already the alternate boot device will
   clear the device's boot status.

Maximum INT 13h Devices for this adapter

   This field specifies the maximum number of devices attached to the
   adapter for which to install a pre-OS IO interface.  The specified
   number of devices in the adapter's device scan order list will have
   an IO interface installed.  An installed IO interface is defined as
   INT 13H.

   X86 platforms allow a maximum of 24 INT 13h devices per system. Therefore,
   fewer than the specified number of INT 13h devices may be installed.  The

*   *   * Field Descriptions *   *   *

Volume Type

   Indicates the type of volume being created.
   
Volume Size

   Indicates the size of the volume in Megabytes.
   
Device Identifier

   This field is the device identifier.
   
RAID Disk

This field specifies the devices (disks) that make up a RAID volume 
(Yes, No, default: NO).

   If Yes, the device is part of a RAID volume.
   If No, the device is not part of a RAID volume.
   
   During the creation of a volume, this field will be No for all 
   members of a pre-existing volume.
   
   This field is grayed out under the following conditions:
   - the device does not meet the minimum requirements for use in a RAID volume
   - the device is not large enough to mirror existing data on the primary drive
   - the device is not interface compatible with another selected volume drive
   - this disk is already a member of another RAID volume

Hot Spr

   This field specifies whether a device is a Hot Spare for a RAID volume 
   (Yes, No, default: NO).
   If Yes, the device will be used as a Hot Spare for the RAID volume.
   If No, the device will not be used as a Hot Spare for the RAID volume.
   Notes:
   - Only two Hot Spares per controller are permitted.
   - RAID volumes do not require any Hot Spares.
   - Hot Spares can only be specified after a volume has been created.

   This field is grayed out on this screen

Drive Status

   Ok              Disk is online and fully functional
   Missing         Disk is not responding or is not present
   Failed          Disk is not accessible or has reported a failure
   Initing         Disk is initializing
   UserFail        Disk is marked failed at host's request
   Offline         Disk is offline for some other reason
   Inactive        Disk has been set inactive
   RAID            Disk is already a member of another RAID volume
   Not Syncd       Data on disk is not synchronized with the rest of the volume
   Primary         Disk is the primary disk in a RAID 1 volume and is OK
   Secondary       Disk is the secondary disk in a RAID 1 volume and is OK
   Hot Spare       Disk is a hot spare disk for a RAID 1 or RAID 1E volume
   Wrg Type        Device is not compatible for use as part of the RAID volume
   Too Small       Disk is too small to be a hot spare for this volume
   Max Dsks        Maximum # of disks allowed for this type of volume reached
                   Maximum # of total IR disks on a controller reached
   Inc RAID        Disk doesn't support SMART or SATA extended commands
   Wrg Intfc       Disk interface (SAS/SATA) differs from existing IR disks
   Inc PI          Disk doesnt support required Protection Information

Pred Fail

   Indicates whether device SMART is predicting device failure (Yes, No).

Size(GiB)

   Indicates the size of the device in gigabytes (where a gigabyte is
   (1024 x 1024 x 1024) = 1,073,741,824 bytes).
   
   If the device is part of a two-disk volume, this field will reflect the size
   of the volume - not the size of the individual disk.
   
   If the device is part of a three or more disk volume, this field is the size
   that the disk makes up within the volume.
   
   NOTE: When creating a RAID 0 volume, the usable size of the volume is
   determined by the Number of drives X Size of the smallest drive in the
   volume. In volumes consisting of different sized drives, excess space on
   larger drives will be unusable.

   (Yes, No, default: NO).
   If Yes, the device will be used as a Hot Spare for the RAID volume.
   If No, the device will not be used as a Hot Spare for the RAID volume.

   This field is grayed out on this screen

Drive Status

   Ok              Disk is online and fully functional
   Missing         Disk is not responding or is not present

   Secondary       Disk is the secondary disk in a RAID 1 volume and is OK
   Hot Spare       Disk is a hot spare disk for a RAID 1 or RAID 1E volume
   Wrg Type        Device is not compatible for use as part of the RAID volume
   Too Small       Disk is too small to be a hot spare for this volume
   Max Dsks        Maximum # of disks allowed for this type of volume reached
                   Maximum # of total IR disks on a controller reached
   Inc RAID        Disk doesn't support SMART or SATA extended commands

   Indicates whether device SMART is predicting device failure (Yes, No).

Size(GiB)

   Indicates the size of the device in gigabytes (where a gigabyte is
   (1024 x 1024 x 1024) = 1,073,741,824 bytes).
   
   If the device is part of a two-disk volume, this field will reflect the size
   of the volume - not the size of the individual disk.
   
   If the device is part of a three or more disk volume, this field is the size
   that the disk makes up within the volume.
   
   NOTE: When creating a RAID 0 volume, the usable size of the volume is
   determined by the Number of drives X Size of the smallest drive in the
   volume. In volumes consisting of different sized drives, excess space on
   larger drives will be unusable.



                               * Manage Volume * 

Manage the current volume.

If the user selects Manage Hot Spare, the utility will display a hot spare
management screen that has the same layout as the Create New Volume screen.

The user will be asked to confirm selections of Synchronize Volume, Activate
Volume, and Delete Volume by pressing 'Y' for yes or 'N' for no.

     Hot Spares. No modifications can be made to a RAID 0 
     volume once it has been created.
   
Consistency Check

   Press Enter to run a consistency check on the RAID volume.
   
   This field is grayed out under the following conditions:
   - The adapter's MPT FW does not support the feature
   - The volume is a RAID 0
   - The volume is not optimal
   - The volume is already running a consistency check
   - The volume has a consistency check pending
   
Activate Volume

   This field is used to activate a RAID volume.

Delete Volume

   This field is used to delete the currently displayed RAID volume.

Online Capacity Expansion

   Press enter to expand the volume's maximum size. This will allow the user
   to create a RAID 1 volume and replace existing volume drive with larger 
   drives. Once each drive is replaced and synchronization for that drive is
   complete, this option will be allowed (presuming a minimum of 50 GiB
   difference between the old RAID 1 volume drives and the new ones).
   
   This field is disabled under the following conditions:
   - The volume is not a RAID 1 volume
   - Firmware is configured to disable this feature
   
                           * Manage Hot Spares * 

This screen allows the user to create, delete, or modify hot spares on the

Volume Size

   Indicates the size of the volume in Megabytes.
   
Device Identifier

   This field is the device identifier.
   
RAID Disk

This field specifies the devices (disks) that make up a RAID volume 
(Yes, No, default: NO).

   If Yes, the device is part of a RAID volume.
   If No, the device is not part of a RAID volume.
   
   During the creation of a volume, this field will be No for all 
   members of a pre-existing volume.
   
   This field is grayed out for this screen

Hot Spr

   This field specifies whether a device is a Hot Spare for a RAID volume 
   (Yes, No, default: NO).
   If Yes, the device will be used as a Hot Spare for the RAID volume.
   If No, the device will not be used as a Hot Spare for the RAID volume.
   Notes:
   - Only two Hot Spares per controller are permitted.
   - RAID volumes do not require any Hot Spares.
   - Hot Spares can only be specified after a volume has been created.

   This field is grayed out under the following conditions:
   - The device does not meet the minimum requirements for use in a RAID volume
   - There are already two Hot Spares on this controller.
   - The maximum number of RAID physical disks have been configured (14).
   - The device isn't large enough to replace a volume disk.
   - A RAID 0 volume is being displayed. Hot Spares are not supported on
     RAID 0 volumes.
